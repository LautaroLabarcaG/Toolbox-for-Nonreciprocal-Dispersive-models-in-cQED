Simplest Example. 

Here, we provide minimal code to obtain the effective coupling rate Eq. (8), for the circuit in Fig. 7(a). 

The objective is to give an idea on how a real workflow would look like. Further calculations, spanning from dispersive shifts, to get the complete exact Hamiltonian can be added without 
major difficulties. 

Files to run the jupyter notebook are already uploaded.

packages.txt contains the packages of the used virtual environement, however exact replication is by no means strictly necessary.
