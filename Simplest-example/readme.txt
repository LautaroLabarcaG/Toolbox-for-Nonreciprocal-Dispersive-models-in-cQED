Simplest Example. 

Here, we provide minimal code to obtain the effective coupling rate Eq. (8), for the circuit in Fig. 7(a). 

The objective is to give an idea on how a real workflow would look like. Further calculations, spanning from dispersive shifts, to get the complete exact Hamiltonian can be added without 
major difficulties. 

Files to run the jupyter notebook are already uploaded.

packages.txt contains the packages of the used virtual environement, however exact replication is by no means strictly necessary.

Disclaimer: Any numerical errors that may be found are exclusively related to the writing of the code. 
The formulas and constructions provided in the article are correct, as proven there.
